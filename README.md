# Mad Scientist Lab Reports Demo

In this scenario, you'll be creating a simulation of a mad scientist's laboratory equipped with an array of sensors that monitor the bizarre and humorous experiments being conducted by the mad scientist **Pexus**.

---

## Types of Experiments

1. **Giant Rubber Duck Explosion Levels:** Sensors in the lab monitor the levels of rubber ducks used in an experiment attempting to create a giant inflatable rubber duck. The data includes `Duckflation Pressure` and `Quack Intensity,` leading up to an inevitable and comical rubber duck explosion event.

2. **Laser-Powered Toasting Efficiency:** Simulate a series of experiments involving lasers used for toasting bread. The sensor data shows `Toastiness Index` and `Crispiness Factor,` while also occasionally indicating `Singed Eyebrow Incidents.`

3. **Quantum Banana Splitting:** Experimenting with quantum mechanics to split a single banana into multiple dimensions. The sensors sends data about `Banana Entanglement Coefficient` and `Flavor Distribution Probability,` leading to strange and amusing banana-related phenomena.

4. **Cookie-to-Monster Transformation Readings:** Sensors track the transformation process of turning cookies into living cookie monsters. Data includes `Sprinkle Count,` `Monster Growl Frequency,` and humorous status updates like `Cookie Rebellion Imminent.`

5. **Infinite Looping Teleporter:** Monitor the activities of a teleportation device stuck in an infinite loop. The sensor data indicates `Loop Iteration Number,` `Teleportation Whirriness,` and occasional `Temporal Paradox Warnings.`

## Data Presentation

After each Experiment a report is generated and can be received in the production from the **com.intersystems.dach.msl.Service**.
